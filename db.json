When swung, it fires a projectile trailed by a rainbow and shaped like a cat's head, and consumes no mana or ammunition. The projectile is affected by gravity, pierces multiple enemies, and ricochets off of blocks. Each ricochet emits an explosion that damages nearby enemies. The projectile disappears after piercing four enemies (hitting the fifth one) or after ricocheting four times (hitting a block for the fifth time).",
